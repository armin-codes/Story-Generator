**So** first of all... this project isn't compeleted YET , and i'll be updating it every day, so stay tuned :) !!

# What's The Base Thing This Program Does?

at the beginning it asks you some questions like the character's name, gender and...
and its like a game but... its a story and you're creating a story! and at the end of it, it will save a .txt file that prints the whole story that the user made
also the user can share their creative stories with others! 

# Future Ideas For This Project

having different genres for each story
Share the stories to a website and winning prizes for good stories
More options(Duh!)

***Overall, I think you have great stories on your hands. I can't wait to see how they'll turns out!***
